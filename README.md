Overall, MediaPipe is a collection of a series of cross-platform, scalable and extremely lightweight Machine Learning solutions. Some possible advantages of this solution include:

Provides a quick inference solution: Google confirms that this toolkit can run stably on most common hardware configurations.
Easy to install and deploy: Installation is extremely easy and convenient, can be deployed on many different platforms such as Mobile (Android/iOS), Desktop/Cloud, Web and IoT devices.
Free and open source code: The entire source code is publicly available on MediaPipe, users can completely use and customize directly to suit their problems.

Face Mesh
Instead of finding a bounding box surrounding the face, Face Mesh is a problem of identifying a series of points on the face, thereby creating a mesh of the face. This mesh will be applied to 3D facial image editing problems or tasks related to 3D Alignment and Anti-spoofing. The tool in MediaPipe will generate a total of 468 points on the face and create a mesh without requiring too much computing power or the number of cameras (only 1 front camera is needed).
